# Shout Plugin
A recreation of an eventscripts soccermod feature with some additional options.  
This was a request and due to certain reasons I was bored enough to do it. However I'm still far from being an expert in SourcePawn  
so, again, expect some heavily improvable code.   

### Features
  ● Modes: Let players emit an ambient sound, or let them emit it to their team only   
  ● Manager: Ingame manager to add, remove or edit the available shouts    
  ● Configuration: While it comes with config files, everything can be configured ingame  
  ● Options:  
     ● Volume, Pitch (global & per shout)  
     ● Cooldown between uses  
  ● Menu & Commands: Shouts can be played from a menu or by individual commands (if enabled)  
  ● In case you want to bulk-add several sounds at once, simply drop them into the sound/shout folder and use the rescan option.  
    Any sound in sound/shout will be added automatically to the list.  
  ● Commands: !shout | !shoutset (requires RCON flag)
